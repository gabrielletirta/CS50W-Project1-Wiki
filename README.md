# CS50W-Django-practices
This repository serves as a continuation of my [Previous Django Practices Repository(CS50W-Project1)](https://github.com/gabrielletirta/CS50-Django-practices). In this new repository, I will do the Project1: Wiki, which I will design a Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this repository is to record and track my daily progress as I advance through the course, particularly focusing on lecture 3: Django practice. This will include code updates, notes, and insights gained during the course.

## Documentations
#27/09/2023 : Read and download the distribution code from CS50W.
